Made from premium 600D high-density Oxford fabric with reinforced stitching, this cover stands strong against UV rays, rain, snow, and road grime. The windproof buckle system and elasticized hem keep it securely in place through high winds and harsh weather—no more flapping, tearing, or re-adjusting. Engineered for a precise fit, this heavy-duty RV cover fully shields travel trailers from 14 to 40 feet—including hitches, bumpers, and rooftop A/C units. Whether parked at home, at the campsite, or in long-term storage, your rig stays protected, clean, and adventure-ready every single day.
